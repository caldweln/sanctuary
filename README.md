# Animal Santuary Data Insights

There exists open data sets for animal intakes, available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/overview.

It may be useful to the operations of such sanctuaries if they could estimate the likely outcome, length of stay or vulnerable profiles.

Model extension and finetuning may be required to translate results to other regions.
